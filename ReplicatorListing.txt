#    Issue: If you run the vbs with "cscript replicator.vbs"  and get an error like --> 
#    
#        THERE IS NO SCRIPT ENGINE FOR FILE EXTENSION “.VBS”

#    Fix:
#    1.  Run cmd as admin and type or paste this in, then restart the cmd shell and try again ->
           regsvr32 %systemroot%\system32\vbscript.dll 
#    2.  If that didn't work, change .vbs file association: 
         - right click replicator.vbs file->properties --> if some other application is associated, fix it.
#        - In properties, click the "change" button, select "Microsoft Windows Based Script Host"
#    3.  You may also need to go to the program that was associated, and remove vb/vbs from the 
#        association in its settings or preferences.  I had this problem with notepad++, had to 
#        remove it to get it cscript to work.
     4.  Restart the cmd prompt and run "cscript replicator.vbs" again.
