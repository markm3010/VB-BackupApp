This is a backup app that reads a cofiguration file to know what 
should be backed up, and where they should go.  It was written in 
VbScript so now it won't work at all.  Thus the reason for writing 
the robobackup backup app...

Crazy how long the VBScript version had to be.  Granted, I wasn't 
going for a short script, but the length of this thing is crazy for 
what it does.
